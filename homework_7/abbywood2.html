        <b>In my junior year of high school, this guy asked my best friend out on a date. He rented a Redbox movie and made a pizza. They were watching the movie and the oven beeped so the pizza was done. He looked at her dead in the eye and said, “This is the worst part.” She then watched this boy open the oven and pull the pizza out with his bare hands, rack and all, screaming at the top of his lungs. They never had a second date.</b>
